Greetings fellow earthling

Lets Conduct CRUD operations on a csv file using python
In order to run this code I would recommend you to instal python and jupyter notebook in your system and open it by typing the command in your command terminal 'python -m notebook'

After the jupyternotebook is open, add the two files in it

File 1: pythonToCsv.py
This file, as the name suggets, creates a csv or excel file using python library - pandas and randomly adding content to it using "faker". You can manually add your own content here instead of randomly generating one.

File 2: updateCsv.py
This file opens the csv file which should be in the same folder or add a path where the csv file is located. You can now Perform CRUD operations of your choice and save it as a new file or update the file by saving back to the same csv file. In my case I have added a new column containing values according to one of the existing columns.

And there you have it! You have succesfully performed CRUD operation on a csv file.
